/**
 * Off-Center Fed Dipole (Windom / OCF) antenna template.

 * A dipole fed at a point approximately 1/3 from one end instead of
 * the center. This provides a feed impedance of approximately 200-300 ohms,
 * which can be matched with a 4:1 balun to 50-ohm coax. The off-center
 * feed point creates multiband operation on even harmonics.

  longDescription:
    "The Off-Center Fed (OCF) Dipole, also known as the Windom, is a half-wave dipole " +
    "fed at a point approximately 1/3 from one end. This feed point location presents " +
    "a feed impedance of approximately 200-300 ohms (matched with a 4:1 balun to 50 ohms). " +
    "The key advantage is that the off-center feed point maintains a reasonable impedance " +
    "on even harmonics, giving multiband operation on the fundamental and approximately " +
    "every even multiple (e.g., 80m fundamental → works on 40m, 20m, 10m). " +
    "Simple construction — just one wire, a 4:1 balun, and coax.",
